# Googlebooks

Googlebooks is a page for users to search for books, using Google's API for their book store, and with the returned results users can save 
what books interest them. Each result shows a picture of the cover, a synopsis of the book, a link to buy the book, and an option to save 
the information. (Stored in a Mongo DB). Users can also delete books they decide to save if they no longer have interest in the book. 

The main goal of this page was to help learn about React and build a full page using the MERN stack. (Mongo, Express, React, Node). This 
is a full stack page making API calls, running on heroku, saving, deleting, and pulling information from a database as well.
